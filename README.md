# Vimba2OpenCV

This is a minimal use example how to grab a picture with Vimba and make it usable in OpenCV in C++. 

## Setting up Vimba in Visual Studio 2019

1. Install Vimba from Allied Vision Website
2. Open your Propety-Manager in Visual Studio
3. Add the Example.props file to your project
```
C:\Users\Public\Documents\AlliedVision\Vimba_6.0\VimbaCPP_Examples\Build\VS2010
```

## How to use
You need to create an GenICam-File with your properties with Vimba Viewer and link it to the camera. I've tested this with GigE Vision Cameras from Allied Vision, I can't say if USB Vision Cameras will work.
